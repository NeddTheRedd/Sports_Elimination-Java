# Sports_Elimination-Java
The program calculates which teams have been mathmatically eliminated from a tournament based on remaining games played, wins, and losses. Built using Java, [BaseballElimination]()  utilizes the "Algorithms, 4th Edition" algs4 package to perform an analysis of a league of teams. We primarily use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate maxflow in a flow network.
